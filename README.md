## Semantic HTML

This project uses semantic HTML to improve accessibility and SEO. Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the web page content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure and content of the web page.

## CSS Methodology

This project uses the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes. BEM helps in writing modular and reusable CSS code.

## Using localStorage

The application uses `localStorage` to persist tasks between sessions. When a task is added, edited, or deleted, the changes are saved in the browser's `localStorage`. This allows the tasks to remain available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
